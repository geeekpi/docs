## What is Home Assistant 

Home Assistant is an open-source home automation system that prioritizes local control and privacy protection, suitable for running on Raspberry Pi or local servers. It is supported by a community of developers and DIY enthusiasts from around the world and is built in a modular way, making it easy to support different devices and actions. Home Assistant can connect to various external devices, such as smart devices and cameras, and can be automated to build personalized smart spaces. However, due to its DIY nature, it has a relatively high threshold for use and may require users to configure and modify configuration files on their own.

In addition, Home Assistant supports connecting devices through the MQTT protocol and can interact with Apple's HomeKit through plug-ins, enabling Siri voice control of smart devices. It also integrates with some third-party intelligent voice platforms, as well as cloud services for weather, exchange rates, online music, etc. The control page can be displayed through a web page or mobile app, supporting Android and iOS systems.

Home Assistant consists of a core component and multiple components. The core component is responsible for general functions such as launching applications and managing states, while components are responsible for interacting with smart devices, cloud services, etc. It supports hundreds of device interaction protocols and cloud services, and users can also add support for specific protocols or devices by adding components.

For the requirement of sending soil moisture (A2) information from the plant watering kit to the MQTT broker through MQTT and displaying it on the Home Assistant page, users need to configure the MQTT component and create corresponding automation rules to achieve data collection and display. For specific configuration methods, you can refer to the official documentation of Home Assistant and tutorials provided by the community.
